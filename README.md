# Using NASA's API to Visualise Meteorite Landings on Google Maps
Ever wondered how many meteorites hit Earth every year and, more importantly, where? 

In this Jupyter Notebook, I use NASA's API to access the relevant data and visualize it on Google Maps using the Bokeh library and the Google Maps API.

See the "nasa_meteorites.ipynb" Notebook for the code.

The maps.html is the actual Google Map that get written to file at the end of the code.
